I'm a software engineer who's passionate about making the best possible products
for people. Software Engineer, open sorcerer, hacker, and laziness-preferer from
Salt Lake City, Utah.

I started this blog to establish a few consistencies for myself, and others.
Firstly, having a routine of blogging is very good. My life is already sparatic
enough, some form of daily routine is well needed. Secondly, for both myself and
others, I'd like to fill holes in knowledge transmission and provide technical
tips or tutorials for topics I find worthwhile.
