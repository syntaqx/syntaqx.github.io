I'm a software engineer who's passionate about making amazing products that
solve problems.

I started this blog to establish a few consistencies for myself, and others.
Firstly, having a routine of blogging is very good. My life is already sparatic
enough, some form of daily routine is well needed. Secondly, for both myself and
others, I'd like to fill holes in knowledge transmission and provide technical
tips or tutorials for topics I find worthwhile.

This site is powered by [Jekyll][] - a static site generator, hosted on
[GitHub Pages][github-pages].
