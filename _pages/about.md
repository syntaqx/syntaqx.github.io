My name is Chase Hutchins. I am a {{ age }} year old software engineer from Salt
Lake City, UT. Vocationally, I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the Platform Team
at [Imgur][].

For pleasure, I'm an open-source software developer, gamer, live streamer,
animal lover and overall nerd. I like to consider myself a driven self-starter
with a passion for making amazing products to solve problems I encounter.

I've rebooted this project in a hope to push myself to be consistent with
blogging in hopes to fill technical gaps in knowledge transmission by providing
technical tips, tutorials, news and general brain-dumps for subjects I have
grown proficient in, or topics I find worthwhile.
