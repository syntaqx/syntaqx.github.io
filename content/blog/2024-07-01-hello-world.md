Hello, world!

I believe this is round 4 of creating/refactoring my site for a blog? I've lost
count. I'm hoping this time I'll stick with it. I've been wanting to write more
and create content so that I can share my thoughts and experiences, as well as
not have to repeat myself consistently for questions I get asked often.

I have no real plans for this blog, but I'm hoping to write about a variety of
topics. I'm sure I'll write about programming, but I also want to write about
other things I'm interested in, like music, games, and other hobbies.

At this point in time, I'm not sure how often I'll write, but I'm hoping to
write at least once a month. I'm not going to set any hard rules for myself,
and just see where this goes.

So, hello again.
