I'm Chase Pierce, Principal Software Architect, creator/maintainer of
[open source projects](https://github.com/syntaqx).

I'm Chase Pierce, a hacker, open sorcerer, principal software architect;
cloudified. I'm your favorite internet junkie with a love of all things digital
and bacon-based.

I am a Utah-based software engineer focusing on the architecture, design and
strategy of digital products and applications. My world is the screen, and I
love to build the products that you click, touch, swipe, tap, or just plain
stare at.

I have always had a fascination with technology, and absorbing the latest and
greatest this field has to offer. Itâ€™s exciting to be able to create modern
products for diverse user bases, and keeping up with the incredible pace of the
industry.
