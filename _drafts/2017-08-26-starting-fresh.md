title: Starting Fresh

For quite a few months now I've been wanting to start being much more active in
the open-source scene as I have been in the past. Additionally, I've really been
wanting to work on my writing skills again.

I decided that the previous site was due for a massive upgrade, so I've slowly
been making some changes around here. It's going to be a bit bumpy over the next
little bit, but I'm excited to be active again!

New content, new projects, and hopefully just more activity in general.
